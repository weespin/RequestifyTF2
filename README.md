RequesifyTF2 is a simple program for Source Engine based games, which supports plugins, micspam, and alot of custom things.
## New Version
I know, im bad at design but UI Framework from WinForms (MaterialUI) was too complex.
I made a new WPF version which includes 🥁:
 1. Game Browser! No need to Manually Select Path!
 2. AutoDevicePicker! No need to Manually select Virtual Device!
 3. Disabling commands! Yeah! Now you can disable commands instad of full Plugins!
 4. Statistics! Yeeaah, but TF2 only :(
 5. ConsoleSender is better now. ConsoleSender is now clearing himself :)
 6. Added alot of languages (to be honest... All TF2 languages)
 7. And.. The project is alive for 2 fkng years!

## About Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC)
#### This programm is not a hack, not a cheat, not modifying game files, not injecting into game processes, not reading and writing into games memory.
My programm is 100% VAC secure, its not even reading game memory!
Its reading 1 file named console.log which was generated by game using in game console command con_logfile "console.log"

Game is writing log from console into a file and im reading this log as text file. Thats all!

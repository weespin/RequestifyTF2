# About Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC)
## This programm is not a hack, not a cheat, not modifying game files, not injecting into game processes, not reading and writing into games memory.
My programm is 100% VAC secure, its not even reading game memory!
Its reading 1 file named console.log which was generated by game using in game console command con_logfile "console.log"

Game is writing log from console into a file and im reading this log as text file. Thats all!

[This programm is working with AHK too but.. its again not injecting. Just emulating your keypressing.](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/a/301540)
